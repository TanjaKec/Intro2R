## Before there was R, there was S! ðŸ¤ 

**R** is a dialect of the **S** language that was developed in 1976 by *Rick Becker* and *John Chambers* at the  Bell Laboratories.

*Rick Becker* gave an excellent keynote talk *"Forty Years of S"* at the UseR!2016 conference:   
[Rick Becker @ UseR!2016](http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/07/rick-becker-s-talk.html) where he talked about the development of the **S** language that gives explanations for many characteristics of **R** as we know it, including "<-" assignment operator.

In 1993 Bell Labs gave StatSci (later Insightful Corp.) an exclusive licence to develop and sell the **S** language. Insightful sold its implementation of the **S** language under the product name **S-PLUS**.

## Then, R was born ðŸ˜‡ðŸŽ¶

In the early nineties at the University of Auckland in the Department of Statistics **R** was created by *Ross Ihaka* and *Robert Gentleman*.

They used [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html) to make R open source free software. 

**R**oss Ihaka and **R**obert Gentleman. <span style="color:orangered">**R**</span>*: A language for data analysis and graphics.* Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics, 5(3):299â€“314, 1996

Currently **R** is developed by the **R Development Core Team**, of which *John Chambers* is a member.

To start using R you need to install it! ðŸ˜ƒ
